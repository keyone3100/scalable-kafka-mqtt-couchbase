- Ok cool. No stress on completion, its more to make your onboarding easier.

- Id suggest to use docker & compose to spin up a Kafka container and a kafka ui container (e.g. Kowl).
- Then try to send a message from node using kafka.JS
- Then, try to create a Couchbase container and explore the web ui
